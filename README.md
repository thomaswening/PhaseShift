# PhaseShift
A stylish productivity timer app for developers, with Pomodoro, stopwatch, and custom timer modes. Designed to keep your focus in phase.

## üçÖ What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a simple time management method:
- Work in focused intervals (typically **25 minutes**) called _Pomodoros_
- Take **short breaks** between intervals
- After a few Pomodoros, take a **longer break**

It‚Äôs a surprisingly effective way to avoid burnout, reduce procrastination, and maintain momentum ‚Äî especially for deep, uninterrupted work.

> üßê **Why is it called _Pomodoro_?**  
> The method was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, who used a **tomato-shaped kitchen timer** while studying. _Pomodoro_ is the Italian word for **tomato** ‚Äî and the name stuck.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Stopwatch Mode** ‚Äì Start, stop, and reset your work sessions with ease.
- ‚úÖ **Custom Timers** ‚Äì Set countdowns for arbitrary tasks and activities.  

## Planned Features

- üçÖ **Pomodoro Timer** ‚Äì Work/break intervals based on the classic Pomodoro technique.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **User Settings & Persistence** ‚Äì Configure durations, themes, and preferences.  
- üîÅ **Stopwatch Rounds** ‚Äì Track multiple rounds/splits within a single stopwatch session.

## Solution Structure

Since PhaseShift is a small project, it is designed with a three-tier architecture in mind: Presentation, Application, and in the future also Persistence.

### PhaseShift.Core

- Timer logic and shared domain models  
- Stopwatch service and abstraction of timer behaviors  
- Designed for testability and decoupling from UI

### PhaseShift.Core.Tests

- Unit tests for core logic

### PhaseShift.UI

- WPF-based user interface using **MVVM** architecture  
- Styled with **MaterialDesignThemes** and **Material.Icons.WPF**

### PhaseShift.UI.Tests

- Unit tests for view models and UI logic

### PhaseShift.AccuracyTestTool

- Prototype tool (optional) to test timer accuracy and behavior  
- Intended for development and testing purposes
