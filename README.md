# PhaseShift
A stylish productivity timer app for developers, with Pomodoro, stopwatch, and custom timer modes. Designed to keep your focus in phase.

## 🍅 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a simple time management method:
- Work in focused intervals (typically **25 minutes**) called _Pomodoros_
- Take **short breaks** between intervals
- After a few Pomodoros, take a **longer break**

It’s a surprisingly effective way to avoid burnout, reduce procrastination, and maintain momentum — especially for deep, uninterrupted work.

> 🧐 **Why is it called _Pomodoro_?**  
> The method was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, who used a **tomato-shaped kitchen timer** while studying. _Pomodoro_ is the Italian word for **tomato** — and the name stuck.

## ⏱ Planned Features

- ✅ **Pomodoro Timer** — configurable work/break intervals
- ✅ **Stopwatch Mode** — simple time tracking
- ✅ **Classic Timers** — countdowns for any purpose
