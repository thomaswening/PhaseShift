> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> Since this is an unsigned app from an individual developer, Windows SmartScreen or your antivirus might display a warning. This is normal for unsigned personal projects. You can learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/).
