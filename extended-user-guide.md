## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pomodoro Timer

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple time management method:
- Work in focused intervals (typically 25 minutes)
- Take short breaks between intervals
- After a few intervals, take a longer break

This is very helpful for staying focused, especially for tasks that feel dull or overwhelming.

### Pomodoro Timer View

When you start PhaseShift, you will see the **Pomodoro Timer** view first.

![Pomodoro Overview](./assets/quick-guide/pomodoro-overview.png)

**From top to bottom:**

- **Current Phase Name:** Displays if you are in Work, Short Break, or Long Break.
- **Remaining Time:** Shows the time left in the current phase.
- **Work Units Representation:**  
  ![Work Units](./assets/quick-guide/work-units-representation.png)  
  Each disk represents a work unit. Completed units are filled. Small gaps represent short breaks, larger gaps represent long breaks.
- **Elapsed Time in Current Phase:** Time that has already passed during the current phase.
- **Pomodoro Control Buttons:**  
  ![Pomodoro Buttons](./assets/quick-guide/pomodoro-timer-buttons.png)  
  - Reset Session: Resets the Pomodoro session to the first work unit.
  - Reset Phase: Restarts the current phase.
  - Start/Pause: Starts or pauses the timer.
  - Skip Phase: Immediately switches to the next phase.
- **Elapsed Time in Session / Total Session Duration:** Displays how much of the session is completed.
- **Progress Circle:** Visual representation of how much time has passed in the current phase.
- **Settings Button:** Bottom-right corner opens Pomodoro settings.

## Pomodoro Settings

Accessible via the settings button:

![Pomodoro Settings](./assets/quick-guide/pomodoro-settings.png)

You can configure:
- Work Unit duration (minutes)
- Short Break duration (minutes)
- Long Break duration (minutes, cannot be shorter than short break)
- Total Work Units per session
- Work Units before Long Break

**Behavior:**
- If long break equals short break, or if work units before long break is 1 or greater than total work units, all breaks are short.
- You can update settings while the timer is running.
- Elapsed session time stays as-is even if phase durations change.
- Reducing phase duration below elapsed time will complete the phase.
- Reducing total work units below already completed units will complete the session.
- **Note:** Currently, settings are not saved after closing the app.
