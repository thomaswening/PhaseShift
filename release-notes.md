## PhaseShift v0.3.1

**Release date:** 13.06.2025

PhaseShift is here! This is the very first release of a sleek and focused productivity timer designed to help you stay in the zone. Whether you're working, studying, or taking breaks with intention, PhaseShift supports your rhythm with clean design and powerful timing tools.

I built this app in my free time, on weekends and during holidays, to create something of my own and to grow through hands-on experience. It started because I was missing a Pomodoro timer on my Windows 10 work laptop. We’ve since upgraded to Windows 11, which now includes one, but I still think mine looks better and offers more flexibility.

As someone who lives with ADHD, I know how hard it can be to stay on track, especially when facing tasks that feel dull or tedious. The Pomodoro technique helps me push through those moments, and I wanted to build a tool that supports that kind of focused, intentional work.

### ✨ Features

This first release introduces the following core features.

* **Standard Timer** — A simple countdown timer with a customizable duration.
* **Stopwatch** — Track elapsed time with start, stop, and reset functionality.
* **Pomodoro Timer** — Stay focused with a Pomodoro-style timer that supports custom work/break intervals and session goals.

### 🔮 Upcoming Features

The following features are planned for the next release. More might be added along the way.

* ⚙️ **User Settings & Persistence** — Configure durations, themes, and preferences, with settings saved between sessions.
* 🔁 **Stopwatch Rounds** — Track multiple rounds or splits within a single stopwatch session.

Here's the updated **How to Use** section with a reassuring link to Microsoft's official explanation of SmartScreen:

### 🚀 How to Use

Just download the executable and run it: No installation required! The `.exe` file includes the .NET runtime and all necessary DLLs, so it works out of the box.

> ⚠️ **Heads-up:**
> Since this app is a personal project and not code-signed (signing certificates are expensive and typically used for commercial products), Windows SmartScreen or your antivirus software might show a warning the first time you launch it.
>
> This is a common behavior for unsigned apps from individual developers. If you trust the source and are comfortable reviewing the source code, you can safely continue.
